An elegant solution for a better typography with beautiful variable fonts.

This plugin allows you to easy use variable fonts, establish a responsive typography and use a modular scale in your WordPress website. No coding required!

You can preview font changes on your website in real time using the WordPress Customizer.

== Description ==

Using variable fonts, you can improve the user experience in your website because you get a better visual hierarchy and more legibility.

A variable font is a single font that acts as many. This results in incredible performance benefits over a standard font: a variable font results in fewer HTML requests, smaller file size (so larger savings of downloaded data) and faster loading speed.

## Variable Fonts

With mowomo Variable Fonts, you can choose a variable font and then you can set the registered and custom axes of that font, for headings, paragraphs, hyperlinks and code.

You can easily choose one variation of a font for headings and a different one for paragraphs.

Also, you can easily set font properties such as font size, line height and letter spacing.

## Responsive Typography

This plugin allows you to improve your website responsive typography with variable fonts in any WordPress theme (no coding required).

Font properties can be set independently for each viewport. So you can set a value for mobile and you can set different values for tablet and desktop.

## Modular Scale

A modular scale is a sequence of numbers that relate one to another in a meaningful way.

By using ratios to create modular scales and setting the font sizes on values from those scales, you can achieve a visual harmony in your layout.

Using this plugin, you can set the ratio and the base that you prefer and all the values will be proportionally set.

## Plugin compatibility

mowomo Variable Fonts will work with all WordPress themes or any visual builder like Divi, Elementor, WPBakery, etc.
